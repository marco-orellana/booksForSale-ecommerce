# booksForSale-ecommerce
This is a java e-commerce website made with JSP and JDBC to connect to a MySql database.

This project was made to test some functions like fetching the books from the database, adding books to the cart, modifying and emptying the cart. 
This is not finished.

I worked on _PanierM.java_, _SessionM.java_, _LivrePanierWrapper.java_, _PanierC.java_, _Panier.jsp_.
I also contributed on the queries for fetching the books and the making of the database.
